# Vis AST

AST visualizer for gencpp

This is a early start to creating frontend tooling for c/c++ using gencpp as a core component.  
I'll be exploring creating an AST explorer for this library with raylib as the graphical & general platform vendor for dependencies that go beyond the scope of gencpp.

For now I'll have its build script in this file, however it will heavily rely on gencpp's helper scripts.

Whatever sort of UX tooling I setup for this will be reused for the other tools I'll be creating for gencpp.
