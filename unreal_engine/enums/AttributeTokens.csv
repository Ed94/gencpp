// TODO(Ed): The Attribute tokens need to be expanded and regenerated on a per-project/installation of this library for a specific codebase of Unreal.
// We can support an arbitrary set of modules or plugin apis for parsing
// but its up to the user to define them all (This will just provide whats be used in previous usages with Unreal).
