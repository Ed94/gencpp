Repo : https://github.com/valiet/quel_solaar

This is a AST reconstruction test of the gamepipeline library.

1. Download the library
2. Grab all header and source file paths
3. Generate an ast for each file and serialize it to a file called <name of file>.gen.<h/c>
4. Reconstruct the ast from the generated file
5. Compare the original ast to the reconstructed ast
