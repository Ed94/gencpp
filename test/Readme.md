# Test

The following tests focus on attempting to generate some math, containers, and the memory module of zpl.

Not all the files are written how I would practically use the librarry,

There will be down the line a proper container, and memory libraries made with this gen library
once the stress test files are complete.

The test is divided between two major sets of tests: Parsed and Nonparsed.

Parsed uses the parsing api strictly.
NonParsed only uses the upfront and incremental constructors.
