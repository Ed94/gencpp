# Test

The following tests focus on attempting to generate some math, containers, and the memory module of zpl.

Not all the files are written how I would practically use the librarry,  
there is a bunch of conditionally compiled code for testing different aspects of the library.

Specifically, Array.hpp is far more complicated that it would need to be;  
with at least double the code that it would actually have to define itself.

There will be down the line a proper container, and memory libraries made with this gen library  
once the stress test files are complete.
